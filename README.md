# Covid-19-CDC-Data-Analysis
This report presents an exploratory data analysis performed on data of some COVID-19 patients in the United States. The data was obtained from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention CDC. The goal of our analysis is to demonstrate the relationships between the patients' mortality rate and the following factors: age, race & ethnicity, sex, having medical conditions, patient hospitalization, and patient admission to the intensive care unit ICU. In order to exclude the effects of the newly innovated vaccines and the new strains of SARS-CoV-2, this report uses only the confirmed cases of the data that have been captured during the period [01/01/2020, 02/12/2020]. The report concludes that all the mentioned factors have significant effects on the patients' mortality rate.
